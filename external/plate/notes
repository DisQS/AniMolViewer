plate is a multi platform api for building applications.

It provides input interfaces and output interfaces.

It is supplied as a header library.

webgl needs emcc eg:

  pushd ~/emsdk
  . emsdk_env.sh
  popd



if shaders are changed or this is the first time building, run ./build-shaders.sh first
